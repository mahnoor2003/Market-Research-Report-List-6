<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drone Surveillance Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PSR(Primary Surveillance Radar)</li><li>SSR(Secondary Surveillance Radar)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Drone Surveillance Radar market is primarily segmented into two types: Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). PSR detects objects by emitting radio waves and analyzing the reflected signals, providing information about the object's location and movement. In contrast, SSR relies on transponders in the drones that transmit data back to the radar, offering more detailed information, such as altitude and identification. Both systems play crucial roles in enhancing aerial surveillance and monitoring capabilities.</p></p>
