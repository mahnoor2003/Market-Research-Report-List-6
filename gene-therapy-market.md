<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viral Gene Therapy</li><li>Non-Viral Gene Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gene therapy market is primarily divided into viral and non-viral gene therapies. Viral gene therapy utilizes modified viruses to deliver therapeutic genes into patients' cells, capitalizing on the viruses' natural ability to infect cells. In contrast, non-viral gene therapy employs alternative methods such as plasmid DNA, liposomes, and physical techniques like electroporation to introduce genetic material without using viruses. Both approaches aim to treat genetic disorders, cancers, and other diseases by correcting or replacing defective genes.</p></p>
