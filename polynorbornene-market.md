<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polynorbornene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Addition Polymerization</li><li>Open-Loop Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polynorbornene is primarily produced through two polymerization methods: addition polymerization and ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Addition polymerization involves the direct linking of monomers to form long polymer chains, typically under specific conditions to control molecular weight and properties. ROMP, in contrast, utilizes the breaking of carbon-carbon double bonds in norbornene-based monomers, facilitated by catalysts, to produce polymers with unique architectures and enhanced properties. Both methods contribute to the versatility and applications of polynorbornene in industries like automotive, aerospace, and elastomers.</p></p>
