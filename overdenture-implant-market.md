<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overdenture Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tooth-Supported Overdentures</li><li>Implant-Supported Overdentures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The overdenture implant market comprises two primary types: tooth-supported overdentures and implant-supported overdentures. Tooth-supported overdentures utilize existing natural teeth as anchors to stabilize the denture, providing improved retention and functionality while preserving the remaining tooth structure. In contrast, implant-supported overdentures rely on dental implants surgically embedded in the jawbone for support, offering superior stability and strength. Both options enhance the patientâ€™s chewing ability and comfort, though implant-supported overdentures typically provide a more permanent and durable solution.</p></p>
