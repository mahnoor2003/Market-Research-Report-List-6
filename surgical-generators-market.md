<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Referenced Generators</li><li>Isolated Generators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ground referenced generators are surgical generators that are connected to ground for safety and stability. They are commonly used in procedures where the patient is insulated from the ground, such as in laparoscopic surgeries. Isolated generators, on the other hand, are not connected to ground and provide electrical isolation between the patient and the generator. They are typically used in procedures where there is a risk of stray currents or electrical interference. Both types of generators play important roles in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of surgical procedures.</p></p>
