<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li><li>Dual-chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li><li>Triple-chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temporary pacemakers are devices used for managing temporary heart rhythm issues. They come in three main types - single-chamber, dual-chamber, and triple-chamber. Single-chamber temporary pacemakers involve one lead placed in either the right atrium or ventricle. Dual-chamber temporary pacemakers have two leads placed in both the atrium and ventricle. Triple-chamber temporary pacemakers have an additional lead placed in the coronary sinus to provide pacing support to all three heart chambers. Each type is used based on the specific needs of the patient's condition.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Temporary Pacemakers Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Arrhythmia and Cardiac Conduction Disorders</li><li>Bradycardia after Cardiac Surgery</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temporary pacemakers are used in various medical conditions such as arrhythmia and cardiac conduction disorders, bradycardia after cardiac surgery, and other cardiac emergencies. Arrhythmia and cardiac conduction disorders refer to irregular heart rhythms that may require pacing to regulate. Bradycardia after cardiac surgery occurs when the heart beats too slowly, often requiring temporary pacing support. Other cardiac emergencies may also necessitate the use of temporary pacemakers to stabilize the patient's heart rate and prevent further complications.</p></p>
