<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Raman Spectroscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immersion Mode</li><li>Stand-off Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Raman spectroscopy is classified into two main market types: immersion mode and stand-off mode. Immersion mode involves close-contact measurements, where the probe is placed directly in the sample medium to achieve high sensitivity and resolution. In contrast, stand-off mode allows for remote analysis, enabling the detection of materials from a distance without direct contact. This method is particularly useful for hazardous or inaccessible samples, facilitating safety and efficiency in diverse applications such as environmental monitoring and security checks.</p></p>
