<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Engine Encapsulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Engine-mounted</li><li>Body-mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive engine encapsulation market is divided into two primary types: engine-mounted and body-mounted encapsulation. Engine-mounted encapsulation involves integrating sound-absorbing materials directly onto the engine to reduce noise and vibrations, enhancing passenger comfort. In contrast, body-mounted encapsulation involves placing soundproofing materials within the vehicle's structure, often surrounding the engine area to insulate against noise and heat. Both approaches aim to improve acoustic performance, thermal management, and overall driving experience by minimizing engine-related disturbances.</p></p>
