<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam</li><li>Double Beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectrometer market is primarily categorized into two types: Single Beam and Double Beam spectrometers. Single Beam spectrometers measure the intensity of light at a single wavelength, providing a straightforward analysis suitable for various applications. In contrast, Double Beam spectrometers split the light into two pathsâ€”one for the sample and another for a reference, allowing for greater accuracy and stability by compensating for variations in light intensity during measurements. Both types serve essential roles in analytical chemistry and quality control.</p></p>
