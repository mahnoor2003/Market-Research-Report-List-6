<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro Invasive Glaucoma Surgery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implants</li><li>Blink-assisted Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The micro invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) devices market is primarily categorized into two types: implants and blink-assisted devices. Implants, such as stents or drainage devices, are designed to lower intraocular pressure by improving fluid outflow. These devices are typically surgically inserted into the eye. Blink-assisted devices, on the other hand, are innovative tools that utilize the natural blinking mechanism to enhance drainage, reducing reliance on surgical intervention. Both types aim to offer safer, less invasive options for glaucoma management.</p></p>
