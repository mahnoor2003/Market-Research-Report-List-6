<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Logic Comparators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Collector</li><li>Totem-Pole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Logic comparators often exhibit two primary output configurations: Open Collector and Totem-Pole. Open Collector outputs can only pull the line low, necessitating an external pull-up resistor to achieve a high state, making them ideal for wired-AND logic. In contrast, Totem-Pole outputs can drive the line both high and low, allowing for faster switching and better driving capabilities. These configurations cater to different circuit needs, with Open Collector favoring flexibility and Totem-Pole supporting direct signal driving.</p></p>
