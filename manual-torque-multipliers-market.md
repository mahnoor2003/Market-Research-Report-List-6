<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Torque Multipliers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reaction Bar Multiplier</li><li>Reaction Plate Multiplier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Manual torque multipliers are tools designed to amplify the torque applied to fasteners, ensuring precise tightening. The reaction bar multiplier uses a lever arm and a fixed pivot point, allowing users to apply high torque with minimal effort while stabilizing the tool against a solid surface. In contrast, the reaction plate multiplier employs a base plate to distribute forces evenly, providing greater stability and torque application. Both types are vital in industries requiring high torque for assembly and maintenance tasks.</p></p>
