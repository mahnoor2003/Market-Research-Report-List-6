<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Power Factor Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Power Factor Controller</li><li>Passive Power Factor Controller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic Power Factor Controllers are devices used to maintain the power factor of an electrical system at a desired level. There are two main types of controllers: Active Power Factor Controllers and Passive Power Factor Controllers. Active controllers continuously monitor and adjust the power factor in real-time by injecting or absorbing reactive power. Passive controllers use fixed capacitors or inductors to correct the power factor. Active controllers are more efficient and precise but tend to be more expensive, while passive controllers are simpler and cheaper but less flexible.</p></p>
